# Dual License
## NLESP Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs, VARs and SPs
 
Nanolat provides its NLESP server and NLESP Client Libraries under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors / service providers (such as OEMs, ISVs, VARs, and SPs) and open source projects.
 
## For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications and SPs

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with NLESP software but do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License (the "AGPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement with Nanolat.
SPs (Service Providers) also need to enter into a commercial license agreement with Nanolat otherwise they are under the AGPL v3.

The commercial license is similar to LGPL, restricting the range of source code to open to NLESP itself.

For start-up companies, Nanolat provides commercial license and technical support at small percentage of equity share. 
Focus on your client side development and grow your business quicker by using NLESP. 
Send an email to support@nanolat.com for the details.

## For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications
 
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL v3 or AGPL v3 that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with NLESP software, Nanolatâ€™s NLESP open source software licensed under the AGPL v3 is the best option.
