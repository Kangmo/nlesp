# Dual License
## NLESP Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs
 
ThankyouSoft provides its NLESP server and NLESP Client Libraries under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.
 
## For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with NLESP software and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement with ThankyouSoft.
 
## For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications
 
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with NLESP software, ThankyouSoftâ€™s NLESP open source software licensed under the GPL is the best option.
 
For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the GPL, ThankyouSoft makes its GPL-licensed NLESP Client Libraries available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the those NLESP Client Libraries under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL.
